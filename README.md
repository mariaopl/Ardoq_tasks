# Tasks for Ardoq

## Task 1
In task 1 I was supposed to create a function that, given a list of integers, returns the highest product between three of those numbers. 
This was done in Python by first sorting the list descending and then looping through the first three numbers and multiplying them.

## Task 2
In task 2 I was supposed to create a small web application that utilizes the open API from Oslo City Bikes. This application shows the stations 
and the amount of available bikes and free spots a station currently has. This was done in React. 

### Quick start
1. Clone this repo
2. Navigate to task2 folder
3. Run the ```yarn start``` command from the terminal
